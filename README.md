# JDORS - WIP - Project
This is a Java 11 (for now) project intended to show some of the language features and 
implementations, and, of course, it will use some of the newest and most used 
technologies, a few of them will be:
* Redis - as a cache memory
* Docker - as a container service
* Spring Security - to provide security tokens
* Sonar - as a code coverage tool

And also I want to implement a AWS - Jenkins architecture, that will be one of the 
main goals of this project.
The second main goal is to create another API in charge of using the
exposed endpoints from this application, that API will be done on
Angular, React, or any other front end framework that allow me to
learn the front end developer world.
